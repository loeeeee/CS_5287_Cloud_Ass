## ✅ Network Issues Resolved (2025-10-20)

### 1. k3s Cluster Network Issues (RESOLVED)
**Problem:** Fundamental networking problems preventing proper cluster operation

**Symptoms:**
- CoreDNS cannot connect to Kubernetes API server (10.43.0.1:443)
- CoreDNS cannot resolve external DNS queries (172.22.100.104:53)
- Service discovery not working between pods
- Pod-to-pod communication failing

**Root Cause Identified:**
The nftables firewall configuration on both k3s nodes had critical issues:
1. **Forward chain blocked all traffic**: The `forward` chain had `policy drop` with no allow rules, preventing Flannel CNI from forwarding pod-to-pod traffic
2. **Missing pod/service network rules**: No firewall rules for pod CIDR (10.42.0.0/16) or service CIDR (10.43.0.0/16)
3. **DNS resolution blocked**: No rule allowing pods to reach external DNS server (172.22.100.104:53)

**Solution Implemented:**
Updated nftables configuration on both nodes:
- **Files Modified:** 
  - `/home/loe/Documents/IaC/nix/k3s-server/nftables.nft`
  - `/home/loe/Documents/IaC/nix/k3s-agent/nftables.nft`
- **Changes Applied:**
  - Added DNS access rules for 172.22.100.104:53 (UDP and TCP)
  - Added inbound rules to accept traffic from pod network (10.42.0.0/16)
  - Added inbound rules to accept traffic from service network (10.43.0.0/16)
  - Updated forward chain to allow pod-to-pod traffic:
    - Allow established/related connections
    - Allow forwarding for 10.42.0.0/16 (pod network)
    - Allow forwarding for 10.43.0.0/16 (service network)
    - Allow traffic between k3s nodes (172.22.0.134 ↔ 172.22.0.135)

**Deployment:**
- Created deployment script: `k3s-networking-fix-deployment.sh`
- Provides step-by-step commands for manual deployment on each node
- Includes verification commands and troubleshooting guide

**Status:** ✅ **DEPLOYED AND VERIFIED** - All networking issues resolved

**Deployment Results:**
- Both k3s nodes: **Ready**
- CoreDNS: **Running** (no connection errors)
- local-path-provisioner: **Running**
- metrics-server: **Running**
- DNS resolution: **Working**
- Pod-to-pod communication: **Verified functional**
- Service discovery: **Working**

See `docs-vibe/003-k3s-networking-deployment-report.md` for complete deployment details.

### 2. Local-Path Provisioner Issues (Resolved)
**Problem:** Local-path provisioner was in CrashLoopBackOff state
**Status:** ✅ Resolved by restarting the provisioner pod
**Impact:** Was preventing PVC creation, now working

### 3. Storage Class Binding Mode Issues (Workaround Applied)
**Problem:** `WaitForFirstConsumer` binding mode causing chicken-and-egg problem
**Workaround:** Switched to simple Deployments without persistent storage
**Status:** ✅ Workaround implemented, but not ideal for production

   - Follow detailed steps in `k3s-networking-fix-deployment.sh`

2. **Verify Cluster Health**
   - Check node status: `kubectl get nodes`
   - Check pod status: `kubectl get pods -A`
   - Verify CoreDNS: `kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-dns --tail=50`
   - Test DNS resolution: `kubectl run -it --rm debug --image=busybox --restart=Never -- nslookup kubernetes.default`

3. **Deploy Kafka Components**
   - Once cluster is verified healthy, proceed with Kafka deployment
   - Follow instructions in `k8s/README.md`
   - Deploy in order: Zookeeper → Kafka → Kafka Connect → Demo Producer

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **Network Prerequisites:** k3s cluster networking must be fully functional before deploying applications
2. **Firewall Configuration Critical:** When using custom firewalls (nftables), the `forward` chain MUST allow CNI traffic for pod-to-pod communication
3. **Storage Complexity:** Persistent storage in k3s requires careful configuration of storage classes
4. **DNS Dependencies:** Service discovery is critical for microservices architecture - both internal (CoreDNS) and external DNS must be accessible
5. **Incremental Testing:** Should test basic cluster functionality before deploying complex applications
6. **Pod Network Forwarding:** Container networking requires explicit forwarding rules for pod CIDR (10.42.0.0/16) and service CIDR (10.43.0.0/16)

## 🔮 Future Improvements

1. **Production Readiness**
   - Implement TLS encryption
   - Add proper secret management
