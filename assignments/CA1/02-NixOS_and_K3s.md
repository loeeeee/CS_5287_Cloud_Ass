# NixOS and K3s Deployment

## Why K3s?

I tried a lot of things with NixOS, but because I am still very new to NixOS, I still could not figure out how many things work. Because how badly NixOS manage their Wiki, and the importance of prior knowledge of the package in configuring the package, I have great trouble creating complex configuration. As a result, I eventually landed on K3s. It is relatively simple and straight forward, while still compatible with full-fat K8s.
